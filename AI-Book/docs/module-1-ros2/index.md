# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of our AI-Native Robotics course! This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that enables seamless communication between AI software and humanoid robot hardware.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of robotic applications, facilitating communication between different software components and hardware systems. In this module, you'll learn:

- The fundamental concepts of ROS 2 and its role in Physical AI
- How ROS 2 enables communication between nodes using topics, services, and actions
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python knowledge
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed on your system
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI, nodes, DDS, and system graph
2. **ROS 2 Communication** - Mastering communication patterns: nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. **Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Creating robot models and connecting them to ROS 2 control

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in connecting AI software to physical hardware
- Implement basic communication patterns between ROS 2 nodes
- Create simple URDF models for humanoid robots
- Understand how to integrate robot models with ROS 2 control systems

## Module Chapters

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

### [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1-fundamentals.mdx)
Learn the core concepts of ROS 2, including its role in Physical AI, nodes, DDS, and the system graph. Understand the analogy of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system.

### [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Patterns](./chapter-2-communication.mdx)
Master the communication mechanisms in ROS 2: nodes, topics, services, and actions. Work with rclpy-based publisher/subscriber examples and understand data flow from sensors to actuators.

### [Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling.mdx)
Explore URDF purpose and structure, learn about links, joints, and frames, and connect URDF models to ROS 2 control systems.
