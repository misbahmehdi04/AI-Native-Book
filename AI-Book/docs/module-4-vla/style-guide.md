# Style Guidelines: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Content Structure

### Chapter Organization
Each chapter should follow this structure:
1. Introduction and learning objectives
2. Core concepts and explanations
3. Practical examples and use cases
4. Summary and key takeaways
5. Self-assessment questions

### Section Headers
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use H4 (`####`) for detailed subsections when needed

## Writing Style

### Language and Tone
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for AI and robotics students
- Avoid overly technical jargon without explanation
- Explain technical terms when first introduced
- Maintain consistent terminology across all chapters

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all technical information with authoritative sources
- Include relevant citations and references
- Clearly distinguish between theoretical concepts and practical implementations
- Note when discussing conceptual vs. implementation details

## Educational Approach

### Conceptual Focus
- Emphasize understanding over implementation details
- Provide conceptual diagrams to illustrate complex ideas
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Focus on "why" and "how" rather than specific code examples

### Progressive Learning
- Start with fundamental concepts before introducing complexity
- Build on knowledge from previous chapters
- Include cross-references to related concepts
- Provide practical examples that reinforce learning

## Formatting Standards

### Text Formatting
- Use **bold** for important terms when first introduced
- Use *italics* for emphasis
- Use `code` formatting for technical terms and file names
- Use numbered lists for sequential processes
- Use bullet points for related concepts

### Diagrams and Images
- Include conceptual diagrams to illustrate system architectures
- Use consistent color schemes and visual elements
- Provide clear labels and legends
- Include alt text for accessibility

### Examples and Use Cases
- Provide real-world examples that illustrate concepts
- Use consistent scenarios across chapters where appropriate
- Include both successful and edge case scenarios
- Make examples relevant to humanoid robotics applications

## Assessment Elements

### Self-Assessment Questions
- Include 3-5 questions per chapter
- Cover both conceptual understanding and practical application
- Provide clear, unambiguous answers
- Link questions back to specific learning objectives

### Key Takeaways
- Summarize 3-5 main points at the end of each chapter
- Connect concepts back to the overall VLA system
- Highlight important considerations for real-world applications
- Provide pointers to additional resources

## Cross-Chapter Consistency

### Terminology
- Use consistent terms across all chapters
- Refer to the shared terminology document
- Update terminology document when new terms are introduced
- Include cross-references to related concepts

### Examples
- Use consistent example scenarios across chapters
- Build on examples introduced in earlier chapters
- Ensure examples align with the overall VLA system
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions

## Review Process

### Technical Review
- Verify accuracy of all technical information
- Check alignment with authoritative sources
- Ensure conceptual explanations are clear and correct
- Validate that examples accurately represent concepts

### Educational Review
- Assess clarity for target audience
- Verify appropriate complexity level
- Check logical flow and progression
- Ensure learning objectives are met
