# ROS 2 Architecture Diagram

This diagram shows the relationship between nodes, DDS (Data Distribution Service), and the system graph in ROS 2.

- Nodes: Independent processes that communicate with each other
- DDS: Middleware that enables communication between nodes
- System Graph: Visualization of node connections and communication patterns
- ROS 2 as a "robotic nervous system" connecting AI software to physical hardware
