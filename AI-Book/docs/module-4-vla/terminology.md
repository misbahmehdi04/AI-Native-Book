# Common Terminology: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Core Concepts

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
A system architecture that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action execution to enable intelligent robot behavior guided by human instructions.

### Voice-to-Action Interface
A system component that processes human voice commands through speech recognition and natural language processing to generate executable robot actions.

### Cognitive Planning
The process by which a robot system interprets high-level goals (often expressed in natural language) and generates detailed action sequences to achieve those goals.

### End-to-End Pipeline
A complete system that takes input (e.g., voice commands) and produces output (robot actions) through a series of processing stages without requiring human intervention between stages.

## Technical Terms

### Speech-to-Text (STT)
The conversion of spoken language into written text, typically using machine learning models like OpenAI Whisper.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

### Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)
A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, and message passing between processes.

### Action Mapping
The process of converting high-level commands or goals into specific, executable robot actions or behaviors.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

### Perception-Action Loop
A continuous cycle where a robot perceives its environment, processes the information, decides on an action, and executes that action.

### Embodied AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate within physical environments through robotic bodies.

## Robotics Concepts

### Navigation
The ability of a robot to move through its environment safely and efficiently to reach desired locations.

### Manipulation
The ability of a robot to interact with objects in its environment using robotic arms, grippers, or other end-effectors.

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study of interactions between humans and robots, including communication modalities like voice, gestures, and visual interfaces.

### Task Planning
The process of decomposing high-level goals into sequences of lower-level actions that a robot can execute.

### Multi-Modal Integration
The combination of different sensory modalities (e.g., vision, language, touch) to enhance robot perception and decision-making.

## Educational Concepts

### Conceptual Focus
An approach to teaching that emphasizes understanding principles and concepts rather than implementation details.

### Progressive Complexity
A learning approach that starts with basic concepts and gradually introduces more complex ideas.

### Cross-Reference
A connection between related concepts across different chapters or modules to reinforce learning.

### Independent Test
A method to verify that each chapter or module can be understood and completed separately while still providing value.
