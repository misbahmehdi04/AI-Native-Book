# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

**Feature**: VLA Module for AI/Robotics Education
**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Branch**: 001-vla-module

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides instructions for accessing and using the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) educational module. The module teaches the integration of language models, perception, and action for autonomous humanoid robots through three comprehensive chapters.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the VLA module, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with artificial intelligence and machine learning fundamentals
- Access to the Docusaurus-based AI book platform
- A modern web browser to view the content

## Accessing the Module

### 1. Navigate to the VLA Module
- Visit the AI book website
- Locate "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" in the course navigation
- Click on the module to begin

### 2. Chapter Structure
The VLA module consists of three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces**
   - Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
   - Mapping voice commands to ROS 2 actions

2. **Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs**
   - Translating natural language goals into action sequences
   - LLM-driven task planning for robots

3. **Chapter 3: Capstone – The Autonomous Humanoid**
   - End-to-end VLA pipeline overview
   - Navigation, perception, and manipulation flow

## Learning Path

### Recommended Approach
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand voice-to-action interfaces
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to learn about cognitive planning
3. Complete with Chapter 3 for the comprehensive capstone experience
4. Review cross-references between chapters to reinforce learning

### Time Estimate
- Total study time: 8-10 hours
- Chapter 1: 3-4 hours
- Chapter 2: 3-4 hours
- Chapter 3: 2-3 hours

## Key Concepts to Focus On

### Voice-to-Action Interfaces
- Understanding speech recognition pipelines
- Learning how voice commands map to robot actions
- Exploring the integration of Whisper with ROS 2

### Cognitive Planning
