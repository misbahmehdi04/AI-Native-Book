# Quickstart: Digital Twin Simulation Module

## Overview
This module teaches physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. It's designed for AI and robotics students with a focus on conceptual understanding.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Access to the course materials

## Module Structure
The module consists of three interconnected chapters:

1. **Physics Simulation in Gazebo** - Covers gravity, collisions, and joints
2. **Sensor Simulation** - Explores LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
3. **High-fidelity Environments and HRI in Unity** - Focuses on Unity-based digital twins

## Getting Started
1. Begin with the first chapter on Physics Simulation in Gazebo
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially to build foundational knowledge
3. Each chapter includes conceptual explanations with minimal examples
4. Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter before moving to the next

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How physics simulation works in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- How different sensors are simulated in virtual environments
- How to create high-fidelity environments in Unity for digital twins
- Human-Robot Interaction concepts in simulation contexts

## Navigation Tips
- Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters
- Each chapter builds on the previous one
- Review concepts before proceeding to ensure understanding
- The module is designed to be completed in 3-4 hours total

## What's NOT Covered
This module focuses specifically on simulation concepts and does NOT include:
- Physical robot deployment
- Hardware integration
- Advanced AI perception or planning systems
