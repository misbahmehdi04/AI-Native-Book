## Integration with Course Curriculum

This module builds upon previous modules (ROS 2 fundamentals, Digital Twin Simulation, AI-Robot Brain) to provide the final integration layer for autonomous humanoid robots. Students completing this module will have a comprehensive understanding of how vision, language, and action systems work together in advanced robotic applications.

The VLA module serves as the capstone for the AI-Native Robotics Book, demonstrating the integration of all previously learned concepts into a unified autonomous system capable of natural human interaction and complex task execution.
