# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)

This module teaches physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. It's designed for AI and robotics students with a focus on conceptual understanding.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How physics simulation works in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- How different sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) are simulated in virtual environments
- How to create high-fidelity environments in Unity for digital twins
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) concepts in simulation contexts

## Module Overview

Digital twin simulation is a critical technology for robotics development, allowing engineers to test and validate robot behaviors in safe, controlled virtual environments before deploying to physical hardware. This module covers the three fundamental pillars of digital twin creation:

1. **Physics Simulation**: Understanding how to model real-world physics in virtual environments using Gazebo
2. **Sensor Simulation**: Learning how to simulate various sensors that robots use for perception
3. **High-fidelity Environments**: Creating realistic 3D environments and designing effective human-robot interactions using Unity

These concepts work together to create comprehensive simulation environments that can accurately represent real-world scenarios for robot testing and development.
