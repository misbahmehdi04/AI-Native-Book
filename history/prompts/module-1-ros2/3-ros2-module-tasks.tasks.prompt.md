# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Task Generation

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for the ROS 2 educational module with 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 user stories (Learn ROS 2 Fundamentals, Master ROS 2 Communication Patterns, Model Humanoid Robots with URDF) plus a polish phase. The tasks are organized with proper dependencies and parallelization opportunities, following the checklist format with task IDs and story labels.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed task breakdown (specs/module-1-ros2/tasks.md) with 43 specific tasks organized by user story priority. The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The structure enables independent implementation and testing of each user story.
