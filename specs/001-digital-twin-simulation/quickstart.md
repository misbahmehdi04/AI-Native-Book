# Quickstart: Digital Twin Simulation Module

## Overview
This module teaches physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. It's designed for AI and robotics students with a focus on conceptual understanding. Digital twin simulation is a critical technology for robotics development, allowing engineers to test and validate robot behaviors in safe, controlled virtual environments before deploying to physical hardware.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Access to the course materials

## Module Structure
The module consists of three interconnected chapters:

1. **Physics Simulation in Gazebo** - Covers gravity, collisions, joints, and SDF basics
2. **Sensor Simulation** - Explores LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor noise modeling
3. **High-fidelity Environments and HRI in Unity** - Focuses on Unity-based digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction design principles

## Getting Started
1. Begin with the first chapter on Physics Simulation in Gazebo
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially to build foundational knowledge
3. Each chapter includes conceptual explanations with minimal examples
4. Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter before moving to the next
5. Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters efficiently

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How physics simulation works in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- How different sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) are simulated in virtual environments
- How to create high-fidelity environments in Unity for digital twins
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) concepts in simulation contexts
- How to apply these concepts for comprehensive digital twin creation

## Key Concepts Integration
The three chapters work together to provide a complete understanding of digital twin simulation:
- Physics simulation provides the foundation for realistic robot behavior
- Sensor simulation enables perception algorithm testing
- Unity environments provide high-fidelity visualization and HRI design
- All components integrate to create comprehensive simulation experiences

## Navigation Tips
- Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters
- Each chapter builds on the previous one
- Review concepts before proceeding to ensure understanding
- The module is designed to be completed in 3-4 hours total
- Each chapter includes exercises to reinforce learning

## What's NOT Covered
This module focuses specifically on simulation concepts and does NOT include:
- Physical robot deployment
- Hardware integration
- Advanced AI perception or planning systems
- Real-world robot control systems
