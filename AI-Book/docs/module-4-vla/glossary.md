# Glossary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## A

**Action Mapping**: The process of converting high-level commands or goals into specific, executable robot actions.

**Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting plans based on new information or changing conditions during execution.

**Ambiguity Resolution**: The process of determining the correct interpretation when language or perception inputs have multiple possible meanings.

## C

**Cognitive Planning**: The process by which a robot system interprets high-level goals (often expressed in natural language) and generates detailed action sequences to achieve those goals.

**Commonsense Reasoning**: The ability to apply general world knowledge to understand situations and make decisions.

**Constraint Integration**: The process of applying robot and environment constraints to planning outputs to ensure feasibility.

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate within physical environments through robotic bodies.

**End-to-End Pipeline**: A complete system that takes input (e.g., voice commands) and produces output (robot actions) through a series of processing stages without requiring human intervention between stages.

**Ensemble Methods**: Using multiple models or systems to improve robustness and handle uncertainty by combining their outputs.

## G

**Goal Decomposition**: The process of breaking down complex goals into simpler, executable subtasks.

**Grounding Problem**: The challenge of ensuring that abstract concepts (like those from language models) correspond to real-world objects and capabilities.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, including communication modalities like voice, gestures, and visual interfaces.

**Hybrid Planning**: Approaches that combine different planning paradigms, such as neural and symbolic planning.

## I

**Intent Recognition**: The process of identifying the high-level goal or action type from natural language input.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

**LLM-Guided Search**: Using LLMs to provide heuristics or guidance for classical planning algorithms.

## M

**Manipulation**: The ability of a robot to interact with objects in its environment using robotic arms, grippers, or other end-effectors.

**Motion Planning**: The process of determining a valid path for robot movement while avoiding obstacles.

**Multi-Modal Integration**: The combination of different sensory modalities (e.g., vision, language, touch) to enhance robot perception and decision-making.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Navigation**: The ability of a robot to move through its environment safely and efficiently to reach desired locations.

## P

**Perception-Action Loop**: A continuous cycle where a robot perceives its environment, processes the information, decides on an action, and executes that action.

**Probabilistic Planning**: Planning approaches that explicitly represent and reason about uncertainty in the world and actions.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing effective prompts to guide language model behavior.

## R

**Reactive Architecture**: An approach to robot control that emphasizes immediate response to environmental changes rather than pre-planned sequences.

**Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2)**: Google's vision-language-action model that combines vision, language, and action capabilities.

**Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, and message passing between processes.

**Robust Planning**: Creating plans that are resilient to uncertainty and environmental changes.

## S

**Shared Autonomy**: A human-robot interaction paradigm where control is shared between human and robot based on capabilities and context.

**Speech-to-Text (STT)**: The conversion of spoken language into written text, typically using machine learning models like OpenAI Whisper.

**Symbolic Planning**: Traditional planning approaches that use formal representations and logical reasoning.

## T

**Task Planning**: The process of decomposing high-level goals into sequences of lower-level actions that a robot can execute.

**Temporal Planning**: Planning that incorporates time constraints and scheduling considerations.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: A system architecture that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action execution to enable intelligent robot behavior guided by human instructions.

**Voice-to-Action Interface**: A system component that processes human voice commands through speech recognition and natural language processing to generate executable robot actions.
