# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)

This module teaches physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. It's designed for AI and robotics students with a focus on conceptual understanding.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How physics simulation works in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- How different sensors are simulated in virtual environments
- How to create high-fidelity environments in Unity for digital twins
- Human-Robot Interaction concepts in simulation contexts

## Chapters

1. [Physics Simulation in Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo.md) - Covers gravity, collisions, and joints
2. [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md) - Explores LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
3. [High-fidelity Environments and HRI in Unity](./unity-hri-concepts.md) - Focuses on Unity-based digital twins

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)

## Navigation Tips
- Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters
- Each chapter builds on the previous one
- Review concepts before proceeding to ensure understanding
- The module is designed to be completed in 3-4 hours total
